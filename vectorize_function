In the exercise, you will learn how to vectorize a function that can only deal with scalar inputs without using a for loop.

# Scalar function
def scalar_function(x, y):
    """
    Returns the f(x,y) defined in the problem statement.
    """
    #Your code here
    if x <= y:
        f=x*y
    else:
        f=x/y
    return f

#Vector Function
scalar_function can only handle scalar input, we could use the function np.vectorize() turn it into a vectorized function. 
Note that the input argument of np.vectorize() should be a scalar function, and the output of np.vectorize() is a new function that can handle vector input.
Please write a vector function vector_function, which will apply the operation defined above element-wisely with input vectors with same dimension x and y. 

def vector_function(x, y):
    """
    Make sure vector_function can deal with vector input x,y 
    """
    #Your code here
    return np.vectorize(scalar_function)(x,y)
