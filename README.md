# Project3 - Digit Recognition (Part2)

## Problem Statement:-
Your friends now want you to try implementing a neural network to classify MNIST digits. 
As with the last project, please use Python's NumPy numerical library for handling arrays and array operations; use matplotlib for producing figures and plots.

Download mnist.tar.gz and untar it in to a working directory. The archive contains the various data files in the Dataset directory, along with the following python files:
        part2-nn/neural_nets.py in which you'll implement your first neural net from scratch
        part2-mnist/nnet_fc.py where you'll start using PyTorch to classify MNIST digits
        part2-mnist/nnet_conv.py where you will use convolutional layers to boost performance

        part2-twodigit/mlp.py and part2-twodigit/conv.py which are for a new, more difficult version of the MNIST dataset
