 # Project 0
 
 ## Problem Statement : -
 The goal of this project 0 is to help you set up your python environment and to give you an introduction to the mechanics of the online grading system.
 As a reminder, this course assumes a basic understanding of Python at the level of 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming using Python (also on MIT Open      CourseWare). 
 
 This means you should be proficient in the following: functions, tuples and lists, mutability, recursion, dictionaries, and object-oriented programming. Additionally, we expect you to be able to install the required packages using pip and be comfortable reading the documentation of these packages to find out more about the functions you are not familiar with. 

## Required python packages

Throughout this course, we will be using Python 3.8 along with the following packages. Code written in new versions of python will be accepted, as long as functions/features that are available only in Python 3.9 or beyond are not used.
- NumPy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- SciPy
- tqdm
-  PyTorch
